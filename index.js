//We are learning loops
//Loops execute a block a certain number of times
//While loops
//A while loop executes a certain block of code as long as an expression evaluates to true
/* while (condition) {
 // code that gets executed as long as the condition is true
} */
let i = 0;//creates a variable i and  sets it to 0
while(i<10){//start the while loop and check the condition that the value of i is smaller than 10
    console.log(i);//the condition is true thus the code logs i and increases by 1 
    i++;
